$ django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME

// we have some installed apps, some of them probably use a table of the database, so next command should be "migrate"
// the migrate command will look into installed_apps and make the tables necessary for the apps.
// (also it will have a look at the migrations came with them)
$ python manage.py migrate

$ python manage.py startapp APP_NAME

// make your models in models.py (APP_NAME/models.py)
// add APP_NAME to installed_apps in settings.py

//the makemigrations command will make this file: APP_NAME/migrations/001_initial.py
$ python manage.py makemigrations APP_NAME

//----------------------------------------------------------------------
// so you change your models in models.py
// you makemigrations of the changes with:
$ python manage.py makemigrations APP_NAME

// then you apply those changes
$ python mange.py migrate

// the reason why these are seperated steps is: use of version control
//----------------------------------------------------------------------

// this will print the sql for 001
$ python manage.py sqlmigrate

// this command will checks for any problems in your project without making migrations or touching the database.
$ python manage.py check
